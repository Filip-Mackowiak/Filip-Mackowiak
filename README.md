# Hi there, it's great to see you! 👋

## Let me introduce myself 🌟
I am a passionate software engineer who never has enough challenges on his list. The world of IT has been an interest of mine since middle school, and ever since I have been studying this field. I started with hardware, moved through a bit of networking, and ultimately fell in love with programming.

If I were to describe myself in a single catchphrase, it would be: “Opportunities don’t happen, you create them”.

## Education and work experience 🎓 💼
I am a 2nd-year Practical Computer Science student at the University of Gdańsk. Aside from just studying, I am a Year Representative, co-founder of the thriving academic club "Work In Progress", and the main coordinator of a growing university-wide initiative which already gathers over 30 students.

Apart from university, I work as a front-end developer in a software company where I have learnt a lot about cooperation and practical usage of my skills.
Combining both my academic and work experience allows me to develop quickly and help those around me.
